Honey is in a lot of hot water lately, as it became known that they took benefit of youtube
creators.

This can needless to say implicate that if they can scam richer people, why would they not
scam their customers. 

Looking around the web i can't find anyone that reverse engineered the plugin to at least 
have a look of what it data it took. I created this repository for me and my nerd friends 
to have a dig at this mess of a code, while also preserving it before updates were made to
cover their tracks. Unfortunatly i didn't make this copy as the new broke, it just struck 
me recently that this is something i might want to dig into, so code might already have been
changed.

Yeh..
